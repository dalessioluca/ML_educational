    "This is a brief introduction to DPP. We are interested in practical application and therefore we focus on the so-called $L_{ensamble}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that DPP are an elegant way to include repulsion between elements. The only thing you need is to specify the **similarity symmetric matrix $L$** where $L$ is positive semidefinite, i.e. **all its eigenvalues are non-negative**.\n",
    "1. The similarity matrix $L$ has size $N \\times N$. For example, if there are $N$ locations on a line the matrix $L$ gives the similarity between any to pair of locations. To achieve particle repulsion we assume that $L_{i,i}=1$ and $L_{i,j}$ decays with the cartesian distance between locations $i$ and $j$. A common choice is to use a gaussian kernel: $L_{i,j}=\\exp[-\\gamma d(i,j)^2]$. This matrix is positive semi-definite. Another common choice is $L_{i,j}=v_i \\cdot v_j$ where $v_i, v_j$ are the vectors corresponding to elements $i,j$ respectively.\n",
    "2. The fundamental property of DPP is that the probability of selecting any subset $Y$ of particles is $P(Y)\\propto det(L_Y)$ where $L_Y$ is the similarity matrix restricted to the rows and columns corresponding to the few particles selected. Neglecting the normalizing constant for a second we see that the probability of selecting just one particle at location $i$ is $P(i) = L_{i,i}$ and the probability of selecting only two particles at locations $i,j$ is $P(i,j) = L_{i,i}L_{j,j}-L_{i,j}L_{j,i} = P(i)P(j) - L_{i,j}^2 \\le P(i)P(j)$, i.e. the particle repeal each other. \n",
    "4. The normalization constant is $\\sum_Y det(L_Y) = det(L+I)$. For example if there are only two locations then there are only 4 possibility: zero particle, one particle at 1, one particle at 2, two particles at 1 and 2. Then we have\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sum_Y det(L_Y)= 1 + L_{1,1} + L_{2,2} + \\left(L_{1,1}L_{2,2} - L_{1,2}L_{2,1}\\right) = (L_{1,1}+1)(L_{2,2}+1)- L_{1,2}L_{2,1} = det(L+I).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Note that we have adopted the convention that the determinant of the empy matrix is $1$, i.e. $det(L_{Y=\\text{empty}})=1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that DPP are probability distribution over all possible subsets of $N$ elements. Obviously the number of such subsets scales exponentially in $N$ but, amazingly, the normalization constant can be computed in $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ operations (any determinant can be computed by LU-factorization).

    "A very nice property of DPP is that an efficient sampling algorithm exists. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use physics to provide the intuition. Suppose that you consider a system of **non-interacting fermions** with Hamiltonian $H=-L$. In this scenario $-L_{i,i}$ describes the external potential at site $i$ and $-L_{i,j}$ describes the hopping between site $i$ and $j$. Now you diagonalize $H$ to obtain its eigenvalues and eigenvectors $\\lambda_i,v_i$. \n",
    "In physics any configuration (i.e. wave-function) of $n$ **non-interacting fermions** can be obtained by filling $n$ single-particle eigenstates and by **anti-symmetrize**. The total energy of the configuration is $E=\\sum \\lambda_i$ and the probability of that configuration is $p\\propto exp[-\\beta E] = exp[-\\beta \\sum_i \\lambda_i ] = \\prod_i f(\\lambda_i)$ where $f(\\lambda)\\equiv \\exp[-\\beta \\lambda]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is the same for DPP with the difference that the function $f(\\lambda)$ is not an exponentail but it is linear, i.e. $f(\\lambda)\\equiv\\lambda$. This is necessary since in the DPP the probability is proportional to the determinant which is just the product of the eigenvalues. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we want to sample the location of particles according to a DPP process we should:\n",
    "1. select a subset of $n$ eigenstate with probability $p\\propto \\prod \\lambda_i $ \n",
    "2. sample the location of the particles according to that anti-symmetrized wave-function.\n",
    "In the math literature, this approach is based on the fact that **DPPs are Mixtures of Elementary DPPs**. In step (1) we select the mixture (of eigenstate) and in step (2) we sample from that mixture without worrying about the values of the selected eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let us say, that you selected the eigenstates $v_1,v_5,v_7$ with probability $p\\propto \\lambda_1 \\times \\lambda_5 \\times \\lambda_7$. Now you have to sample the location x,y,z of these three particles correspong to the wave-function \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\psi(x,y,z)= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 3} det \\begin{bmatrix}v_1(x) & v_1(y) & v_1(z) \\\\v_5(x) & v_5(y) & v_5(z) \\\\ v_7(x) & v_7(y) & v_7(z) \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Step (1) is trivial. Step (2) on the other hand is still difficult because we do NOT want to work with the full wave-function. If there are 100 locations on the line to choose from the three-particles wave-function above has $100^3=10^6$ distinct values. The brute force approach would be to use the three selected eigenstates to compute the $10^6$ entries for the matrix $M_{i,j,k}$ and then select one entry proportionally to its value. The selected entry would specify, at once, the locations of the three particles. **This, all at one approach, scales badly with the number $n$ of particles** (the total wave-function has $N^n$ values). We would much rather **sample one particle at the time and then update the wave-function to take into account the previous choices**."
